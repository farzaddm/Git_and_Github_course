## GitHub Gists

GitHub Gists offer a simple way to share small pieces of code or text.

They have fewer features than a typical GitHub repository — no issues, pull requests, or project boards — but they're perfect for sharing code snippets, notes, or quick scripts.

## GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages** lets you host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.

There are **two kinds of GitHub Pages sites**:

1. **Project Pages** — one for each repository.
2. **User/Organization Pages** — one site for your entire GitHub account or organization.

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> You can only host **static files** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) on GitHub Pages. Server-side code like Python, Node.js, or PHP won’t work.

**How to set up GitHub Pages:**

* Go to your repository’s **Settings**.
* Find the **Pages** section.
* Choose the branch and folder where your website files (like `index.html`) are located.

**Best practice:**
It’s a good idea to keep your website files in a separate branch (commonly named `gh-pages`) to avoid mixing them with your main project source code.

If a `gh-pages` branch exists, GitHub will often detect and suggest it by default when setting up your Pages site.
