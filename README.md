# 📒 Git & GitHub Notes (Based on Colt Steele’s Udemy Course)

Welcome to my personal notes from Colt Steele's Git & GitHub course on Udemy! 🚀
I actually forked his notes and completed them myself — adding extra explanations, diagrams, and command examples along the way.

This repository is a neatly organized collection of notes covering essential Git and GitHub workflows. 🔧🐙
I created it both for my own learning and as a quick reference, and I’m sharing it here in case it’s helpful to others too. 🙌
